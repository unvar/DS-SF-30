# DS-SF-30 | Dataset for the Unit Project, Parts 1-4

We'll be using the UCLA's Logit Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python.  Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school.

The dataset contains four variables: `admit`, `gre`, `gpa`, and `prestige`:
- `admit` is a binary variable.  It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted into UCLA (`admit = 1`) or not (`admit = 0`).
- `gre` is the GRE score.  GRE stands for Graduate Record Examination.
- `gpa` is the GPA score.  GPA stands for Grade Point Average.
- `prestige` is the prestige of an applicant alta mater, with 1 as highest tier (most prestigeous) and 4 as the lowest tier (least prestigeous).
