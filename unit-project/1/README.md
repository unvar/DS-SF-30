## PROMPT

"A problem well-stated is half-solved" -- Charles Kettering

Welcome to Data Science!  In this first project you will create a framework to scope out data science projects.  This framework will provide you with a guide to develop a well-articulated problem statement and analysis plan that will be robust and reproducible.

**Objective:** Create a problem statement, analysis plan, and data dictionary.

## DELIVERABLES

### Completed Jupyter Notebook

- **Requirements:**
  - Identify the variables of the dataset, including the response and predictors.
  - Create a data dictionary with classification of available variables.
  - Write a high quality problem statement.
  - State the risks and assumptions of your data.
  - Outline exploratory data analysis methods.

## RESOURCES

### Dataset

The dataset is available [here](../dataset).

### Starter code

For this project we will be using an Jupyter Notebook.  Jupyter Notebooks are a handy way to communicate your research with your team and share your analysis.  Using markup syntax will allow you create more visually appealing notebooks.

* Open the [starter notebook](./notebooks/unit-project-1-starter-code.ipynb) in Anaconda.

### Sample Deliverables

Check out the [sample notebook](./notebooks/unit-project-1-sample.ipynb), which includes a data dictionary and responses to questions.  Wonder how to format your notebook the same way?  Simply double-click on any section to view the markdown.

### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Get used to the Jupyter Notebook layout.  Play around with keyboard shortcuts.
- Try out basic markdown for commonly used formats; look up commands for headers, bold, italic, and tables.
- **Read the documentation for Jupyter Notebooks.**  Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a data scientist!
